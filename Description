This is a Python-based BMI Calculator with a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter. It calculates Body Mass 
Index from user input, classifies it into categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), and stores the 
results in memory. A dynamic BMI trend graph is also generated using Matplotlib, helping users track their
health over time. This project showcases core Python concepts including GUI design, data handling, and visualization.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
ðŸ–¥ GUI Interface (Tkinter)

ðŸ“ˆ BMI Trend Graph (Matplotlib)

ðŸ—ƒ Stores BMI history during session

ðŸ“‹ Categorizes BMI (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

âœ… Input validation with error handling

This project helped me practice GUI development, data visualization, and basic health logic using Python.
